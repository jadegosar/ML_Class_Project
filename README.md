# Machine Learning Grad Class Final Project
My class was given the following business situation:
You are a data scientist at a grocery store chain and are asked by management how to make the Orange Juice category perform better than what it does currently. You learn that the grocery store chain sells two brands of orange juice Citrus Hill (CH) and Minute Maid (MM). MM gets higher margins than CH. The Brand Manager is interested in finding out what variables influence a customerâ€™s probability of buying MM. On the other hand, the sales manager is interested in building a predictive model in which he can simply predict the probability of a customer purchasing MM. They ask you to present a written report in which you clearly explain the method and your recommendations in a userfriendly manner.

In this project we were tasked with answering the following based on the business situation:
Questions from the Brand manager
1. What predictor variables influence the purchase of MM?
2. Are all the variables in the dataset effective or are some more effective than others?
3. How confident are you in your recommendations?
4. Based on your analysis what are the specific recommendations you have for the brand manager?
Questions from the Sales manager
1. Can you build a predictive model that can inform him the probability of customers buying MM?
2. How good is the model in its predictions?
3. How confident are you in your recommendations?
